## Usage

Usage Instructions:

    Users can add YouTube videos to the playlist by performing a search
    and clicking on any of the search results; users can click outside of the search results modal to exit;

    A user can click on the magnifying glass in the YouTube search field without any query and it will display 25 YouTube-generated default search results;

    Users can up/downvote the playing video or queue items.  Items with more downvotes than upvotes will be removed.

    Only the user that adds a video to the playlist can skip the video without requiring a majority of down votes;

    Users can pause videos being played and then click sync to catch up to where the video is currently at for everyone else;

    Only the user that adds a video to the playlist can click remove to delete the video from the playlist;

    Chat is full-featured with emojis, private messaging, and hidden methods for you to find.
